                        a
                        eCommerce
                        specailist. I am 18 years old starting my journey to become a web developer. I am very family
                        oriented, so everything I do is for the family I plan to grow down the road. On top of that, I
                        am a
                        God-fearing man so I have certain things in my life that are non-negotiable. I am driven to
                        become
                        established in this field becasue I know this field will allow me to sustain my family from the
                        comfort of my home, so I won't miss out on what really matters. I did not go to college, but I
                        am
                        certified in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I am always striving to learn to expand my knowledge.
