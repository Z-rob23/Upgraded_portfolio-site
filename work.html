                        <p class="info-description">Here I built a custom blog template for a client and then filled in
                            the
                            content she had later on. This required advanced HTML and CSS as the format was pretty
                            unique
                            and I built a custom tab page for different links in the template. This was done on Shopify
                            and
                            since this project I have gained enough knowledge to offer basically all things development
                            on
                            Shopify.</p>

                        <p class="info-description">Here I built an entire site based around two products on Shopify.
                            There
                            are great features used in this store like custom templates, Shopify apps, custom
                            blocks/sections, and detailed customizations. This is a great build to display my knowledge
                            of
                            Shopify
                            along with HTML and CSS because the features listed requires said knowledge. With the
                            experience
                            I've gained, I can build sites like these with more or less products/features very quickly
                            and
                            keep the site updated overtime!</p>

                            and
                            JavaScript, and the design is unique as well. I came up with ideas as I went and slowly
                            starting putting the pieces together. I also hosted it myself using a secured browser and a
                            SSL
                            certificate.</p>

                            they come from. This build shows the whole 9 yards of Front-End Development. I built the
                            app
                            with JavaScript and HTML then styled it with CSS.</p>
